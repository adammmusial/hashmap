# HashMap Implementation

## About the Project
I created a custom HashMap in JavaScript to understand how hash tables work under the hood. This HashMap class has methods to add, get, and remove key-value pairs, check if a key exists, and retrieve all keys, values, and entries. I also built a MapProto class using JavaScript's built-in Map object to see the differences and similarities. This project was a great way to dive into data structures and algorithms, especially focusing on how hash functions work and how to handle data efficiently.

## Key learnings:
- Learned how to create and use hash functions
- Handled collisions in a hash table
- Developed methods for common data operations
- Compared custom data structures with built-in JavaScript objects

## Features
- `set(key, value)`: Assigns a value to a key. If the key exists, the value is updated.
- `get(key)`: Returns the value for a given key. If the key is not found, returns null.
- `has(key)`: Checks if a key exists in the hash map. Returns true or false.
- `remove(key)`: Removes the entry with the given key. Returns true if the key was removed, false if the key was not found.
- `length()`: Returns the number of stored keys.
- `clear()`: Removes all entries.
- `keys()`: Returns an array of all keys.
- `values()`: Returns an array of all values.
- `entries()`: Returns an array of key-value pairs.
