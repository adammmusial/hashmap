# HashMap Implementation

## About the Project
I created a custom HashMap in JavaScript to understand how hash tables work under the hood. This HashMap class has methods to add, get, and remove key-value pairs, check if a key exists, and retrieve all keys, values, and entries. I also built a MapProto class using JavaScript's built-in Map object to see the differences and similarities. This project was a great way to dive into data structures and algorithms, especially focusing on how hash functions work and how to handle data efficiently.

## Key learnings:
- Learned how to create and use hash functions
- Handled collisions in a hash table
- Developed methods for common data operations
- Compared custom data structures with built-in JavaScript objects
